YM PLAYER by The Beast/Typhoon (St‚phane Perez)
===============================================

This is a crappy YM player... but it works !
YM files are soundchip files for PC and they
come from Atari ST, Amstrad CPC, and so on.
It wasn't tested with "YM4!" and "YM6!" files

HELP WANTED :

- I am looking for "YM1!", "YM4!" and "YM6!" tunes
  to help me writting a more powerful player.
- Please who can send me a LZH depacking routine ?
  YM files are f*cking BIG !

***** WHAT IS NOT PLAYED : ***********************
-> LHA-packed musics (PLEASE pack them with Speed
   or Atomik or Ice packers !)
-> "YM1!" format (does it exist ?)
-> Some "YM6!" tunes aren't well played because
   they are played as "YM5!" ones...  :)
-> Non-interleaved musics (very rare)
-> SID-voice
-> Digidrums
**************************************************

This player is freeware. It was written in GFA
Basic 3.5. The source code is available, just
tell me if you're programming another player
using this source, or if you're optimising
this source. Thanks!

Get in touch with me: thebeast@caramail.com

Changes from 0.1 to 0.2 :
- now the player correctly sets the register 13 of
  the YM.

Changes from 0.2 to 0.3 :
- now plays "YM4!", "YM5!" and "YM6!" tunes.
- Atari packers recognized : Atomik 3.5/3.6, Speed
  Packer 3.0 and Ice Packer 2.4
- some more bugs were removed.
